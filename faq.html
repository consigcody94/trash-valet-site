            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>It's simple! We provide each unit with a bin to place outside their door. Residents place their trash in the bin by 8 PM, and our uniformed valets collect it during our evening collection window (typically 8 PM - 12 AM). We transport all trash to your property's main dumpster, so residents never have to make that walk themselves.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>Collection frequency is customizable based on your community's needs. Our most popular option is 5 nights per week (Sunday-Thursday), but we also offer 3, 4, 6, or 7-night options. We'll help you determine the best schedule based on your resident count and community preferences.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>Our standard collection window is 8 PM to 12 AM. Residents must have their trash out by 8 PM on collection nights. This evening schedule ensures we don't disturb residents during dinner hours while still completing collection before late night. The exact time varies by route, but your trash will always be collected that night.</p>

              <p>Absolutely! We offer full recycling services as an add-on to any plan.

              <p>We observe 6 major holidays: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. On these holidays, service may be suspended.

            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>If a resident misses the 8 PM cutoff, they simply wait until the next collection night. Our valets follow strict routes and schedules to ensure efficient service for all residents.

            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>We bill the property management company directly on a monthly basis.
